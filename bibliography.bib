  abstract     = {A procedure for estimating the reliability of sets of ratings in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient is discussed. The procedure is based upon the analysis of variance and the estimation of variance components. For the one-way classification the intraclass correlation coefficient defined as the ratio of variances can be interpreted as a correlation coefficient. Caution, however, is urged in the application of the definition to a two-way model, i.e., one in which between-rater variance is removed. It is maintained that the frequent use of the standard definition of the one-way intraclass correlation coefficient applied to the two-way classification is not a proper procedure if in fact the coefficient is to be interpreted as a correlation coefficient. Definitions for reliability obtained from the two-way models are given which can legitimately be considered correlation coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of {ICC} in the content of reliability analysis.  Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of {ICCs}. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the {ICC} form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of {ICC} to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting {ICC} should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections.  Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes {ICC}, readers should first check whether information about the {ICC} form has been reported and if an appropriate {ICC} form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the {ICC} estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively.  Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of {ICC} and suggests the best practice of reporting {ICC} parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across {ICC} while reading an article.},

  abstract     = {A re-analysis of intraclass correlation ({ICC}) theory is presented together with Monte Carlo simulations of {ICC} probability distributions. A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score {ICC} is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score {ICC} formulas. A near equality of the three {ICC} values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) {ICC} may be used. A consistency {ICC} larger than absolute agreement {ICC} indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical {ICC} is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement {ICC} and consistency {ICC} should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.},
